In this part we will discuss the question : how to find the best model using artificial intelligence?
This involves a combination of approaches, including model-based machine learning (ML), incremental learning methods, and the integration of machine learning into domain modeling. 
Model-based machine learning involves specifying ML problems using a dedicated modeling language and generating the corresponding ML code automatically, allowing for the creation of highly tailored models for specific scenarios and rapid prototyping and comparison of alternative models\cite{evolutionMDE}. In the paper A Model-Driven Approach to Machine Learning and Software Modeling for the IoT \cite{mdApproach} a new approach is presented. It is based on the domain-specific modeling (DSM) methodology and involves the creation of a domain-specific modeling language (DSML) that can be used to generate ML models as well as code for their implementation.
Incremental learning methods, such as those based on Hoeffding bounds and Hoeffding trees, have been proposed as a way to efficiently process and analyze massive data streams in real-time\cite{evolutionMDE}. 
The integration of machine learning into domain modeling involves decomposing ML into small, reusable units called microlearning units \cite{evolutionMDE}, which can be modeled and used alongside domain data, allowing for the flexible combination of learned behaviors and domain knowledge. An example of machine learning integration is given in the paper ThingML \cite{ThingML}.  ThingML is an open source MDE solution for CPS and IoT systems that uses a domain-specific modeling language, methodology, and tool to allow for the specification of distributed systems using components, composite state machines, and an action language. The paper proposes the integration of Machine Learning (ML) into the ThingML approach in order to enable the development of data-driven behavior in Cyber-Physical System (CPS) and IoT systems.
In addition, the availability of large and high-quality datasets, such as the ModelSet dataset \cite{modelset}, is crucial for the application of machine learning in model-driven engineering. The ModelSet dataset includes over 10,000 labeled models and aims to address the need for a large and high-quality dataset of software models for use in ML research.
Overall, we saw that artificial intelligence application to model driven engineering has a great potential but has not been fully explored yet.
